# Deployment Strategy: Aave Not on Testnet

## The Problem

- ❌ Aave v3 is NOT deployed on Celo testnets (Sepolia, Alfajores)
- ✅ Aave v3 IS deployed on Celo Mainnet only

## The Solution: Two-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Local Fork Testing (FREE, SAFE)

Test the updated contract with real Aave contracts on a local fork.

**Terminal 1 - Start fork:**
```bash
cd smartcontract
npx hardhat node --fork https://forno.celo.org
```

**Terminal 2 - Deploy and test:**
```bash
cd smartcontract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-to-fork.js --network localhost

# Test deposit, withdrawal, yield, etc.
npx hardhat run scripts/test-vault-on-fork.js --network localhost
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Free - no gas costs
- ✅ Real Aave contracts
- ✅ Can reset state anytime
- ✅ Full testing capabilities
- ✅ No risk to real funds

### Phase 2: Celo Mainnet Deployment (For Hackathon)

Once thoroughly tested on fork, deploy to mainnet.

**Why mainnet?**
- 🏆 Required for Aave hackathon prize ($2,500)
- 🏆 Demonstrates real-world functionality
- 🏆 Shows production readiness

**Safety measures already in place:**
```solidity
✅ Identity verification required
✅ Max 10,000 cUSD per user (manageable risk)
✅ Max 100,000 cUSD total TVL (low exposure)
✅ Pause mechanism for emergencies
✅ All deposits go to real Aave (earn yield)
```

**Deploy to mainnet:**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-to-fork.js --network celoMainnet
```

(Note: Update the script to work with ethers v5 syntax for mainnet)

---

## Recommended Flow

1. **Test on local fork** (do this first!)
   - Validate the fixes work
   - Test all deposit/withdraw flows
   - Verify yield accrual
   - Test edge cases

2. **Deploy to mainnet** (when ready)
   - Start with very small test deposit
   - Monitor for 24 hours
   - Gradually increase if everything works

## Alternative: Ethereum Sepolia

If you want a testnet with Aave:

**Option: Deploy to Ethereum Sepolia** (Aave IS deployed there)
- Use ETH Sepolia network
- Change addresses to Sepolia Aave contracts
- Could work, but loses Celo/Mobile-first narrative

**Tradeoffs:**
- ✅ Full testnet environment
- ❌ Not on Celo (might confuse judges)
- ❌ Loses mobile-first advantage

---

## My Recommendation

**Best approach for hackathon:**

1. **Test thoroughly on local fork** (next 1-2 hours)
2. **Deploy to Celo Mainnet** (required for prize)
3. **Use strict testing workflow:**
   - Test with 1 cUSD first
   - Monitor for yield accrual
   - Test withdrawal
   - Only then allow larger deposits

**Expected costs:**
- Mainnet deployment: ~2-3 CELO (~$3-5)
- Testing transactions: ~1 CELO (~$2)
- Total: ~$5 for full deployment + testing

**Risk level:** LOW
- Max 10k per user
- Total 100k TVL cap
- Identity verification
- Pause mechanism
- Funds in real Aave earning yield

## Quick Start: Test on Fork NOW

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd smartcontract
npx hardhat node --fork https://forno.celo.org

# Terminal 2
cd smartcontract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-to-fork.js --network localhost
```

Then create test scripts to validate everything works!
